    \item \textbf{MAT301: Mark Correction}. Put this title whenever you feel a correction is needed in one of your homeworks or midterm.
    \item \textbf{MAT301: Math Doubt}. If you have a mathematical doubt.
    \item \textbf{MATH301: Administrative Issue}. If you have any other concern that doesnâ€™t fall into the previous categories.

\subsection{Evaluation Criteria}

We will follow the following grading scheme for this course.

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        10 Homeworks (drop the lowest scored one of the first five and of the last five) & 25\% \\
        \hline
        Midterm & 25\% \\
        \hline 
        Final Examination & 50\% \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Notice that \bred{late homework submission are usually given mark zero}. Exceptions due to required accommodations or unexpected circumstances will be of course taken into account and discussed in a case by case basis. Please write to the instructor in these situations. 

Any grade curve that might occur will only be done over the final course mark and not for particular homework, midterm or final test.

\section{Course Description}

This course covers Groups oriented to computations. In order to understand groups well, a solid background in \itblue{linear algebra} is required: matrices, determinants, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, etc. \itblue{Modular arithmetic} is also required, as well as some basic notions of \itblue{number theory}.
